# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project is to compare performance across tweleve different stocks across 2017 and 2018. This includes examining the Total Daily Volume, the return of each stock over the year and comparing returns from 2017 and 2018.   
This analysis was done using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), an excel based programming language that can be used to help automate analysis. In addition, to examining the returns of different stocks, a comparision will be done between original VBA script and refactored VBA script to determine which one ran faster. 

## Results
### Stock Performance
Overall, most of the stocks in this analysis performed significantly better in 2017 than in 2018. As can be seen in the below screenshots only two stocks performed better in 2018 than 2017, RUN and TERP. HOwever, there are only two stocks that provided positive returns in 2018, ENPH and RUN, with a 81.9% and 84% return respectively. When compared against the Total Daily Volume, both ENPH and RUN had significant increases in the volume of stock being traded. ENPH's Total Daily Volume in 2018  by 174% while RUN's Total Daily Volume increased by 88%, when compared to 2017. This large increase in Total Daily Volume can indicate that there is an increased level of interest in the respective stock, especially by large institutional investors. This interest can help drive up the price of the stock could indicate that it is a worthwhile stock to invest in. However, the Total Daily Volume should not be considered as a sole factor. DQ also had a large increase in Total Daily Volume between 2017 and 2018 but its return is down significantly. Given that this dataset is looking at a full year it is possible the data is slightly skewed. DQ performed much better at the beginning of 2018 and its performance did not start declining until later in the year. Going forward it might make more sense to look at stock performance trending by month or quarter to be able to identify changes in performance faster.
